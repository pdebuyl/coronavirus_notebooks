# Coronavirus notebooks

**Disclaimer:** I am not an epidemiologist nor a medical doctor. I am a
physicist with an interest in dynamical systems. These notebooks are for
pedagogical purposes, intended for a modeling audience and not for the
general public. This is not public health advice. My motivation was to
share some code for the models as many figures have been circulating
online, but few come with a code (or a simple code), in the spirit
of open science.

## Status

I started to test the SEIR model on march 9 and for a few days the model
matched well. Then, either due to the model not being adequate or the data
being completely off, the match became less consistent. The plain lin-log plot
of the number of cases still illustrates the exponential growth.
